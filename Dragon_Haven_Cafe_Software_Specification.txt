2. Game Systems Overview
2.1 System Architecture
The game consists of five interconnected core systems that communicate through a central Game State Manager:
SystemPrimary FunctionDependenciesDragon SystemManages dragon state, growth, abilities, and bondingTime, Inventory, WorldCafe SystemHandles cafe operations, recipes, customers, reputationInventory, Time, StoryWorld SystemControls exploration, resource spawning, weatherTime, Dragon, StoryStory SystemManages narrative, character arcs, progression gatesCafe, Time, DragonTime SystemControls day/night cycle, seasons, schedulingNone (core system)
2.2 Game Loop
Each in-game day follows this primary loop structure:
1. Morning Phase: Wake up, check dragon status, optional garden harvest
2. Exploration Phase: Gather ingredients, discover recipes, bond with dragon
3. Cafe Operation: Morning service (10:00-14:00), evening service (17:00-21:00)
4. Story Events: Character interactions trigger based on conditions
5. Evening Phase: Feed dragon, review day summary, save and sleep


3. Dragon Raising System
3.1 Dragon Life Stages
The dragon progresses through five distinct life stages, each unlocking new abilities and changing the dragon's appearance and size:
StageDurationSizeKey AbilitiesEggDay 1-330cm diameterNone (incubation period)HatchlingDay 4-10Cat-sized (40cm)Crawl into small spaces, fetch itemsJuvenileDay 11-25Large dog (1m)Break rocks, intimidate small creaturesAdolescentDay 26-45Horse-sized (2m)Glide short distances, fire breath (weak)AdultDay 46+Large (4m wingspan)Full flight, powerful fire, rideable
3.2 Dragon Stats & Attributes
3.2.1 Core Stats
StatRangeEffectsRecovery MethodHunger0-100Below 30: reduced stamina regenFeed any cooked dishStamina0-100 (scales with stage)Depletes during abilities, explorationRest, feeding, time passageHappiness0-100Affects ability effectiveness, color vibrancyPetting, playing, favorite foodsBond Level0-1000 (lifetime)Unlocks abilities, story scenes, final evolutionAll positive interactions
3.2.2 Dragon Color System
The dragon's color changes based on the types of food consumed. Color is tracked as RGB values influenced by food categories:
• Red Channel: Increased by spicy foods, meat dishes, warm-temperature foods
• Green Channel: Increased by vegetable dishes, salads, herb-based recipes
• Blue Channel: Increased by seafood, cold dishes, desserts with berries
Color transitions occur gradually over 3-5 feedings, allowing players to deliberately influence their dragon's appearance.

3.4 Dragon Data Structure
The following data structure defines a dragon entity:
 DragonEntity {     // Identity     id: UUID     name: String (player-assigned, max 20 chars)     createdAt: DateTime          // Growth     stage: Enum (EGG, HATCHLING, JUVENILE, ADOLESCENT, ADULT)     daysInStage: Integer     totalDaysAlive: Integer          // Stats (0-100 unless noted)     hunger: Float     stamina: Float     maxStamina: Float (calculated from stage + bond)     happiness: Float     bondLevel: Integer (0-1000)          // Appearance     colorRGB: {r: Float, g: Float, b: Float} (0.0-1.0)     colorTargetRGB: {r: Float, g: Float, b: Float}     colorTransitionProgress: Float (0.0-1.0)          // Abilities     unlockedAbilities: Array<AbilityID>     abilityExperience: Map<AbilityID, Integer>          // Preferences (discovered through gameplay)     favoriteFoods: Array<RecipeID> (max 5)     dislikedFoods: Array<RecipeID> (max 3)          // Daily tracking     fedToday: Integer     pettedToday: Integer     abilitiesUsedToday: Integer }


4. Cafe Management System
4.1 Cafe Operations Overview
The cafe operates during two service windows each day. Players must balance time between cafe duties, exploration, and dragon care.
Service PeriodTime WindowCustomer VolumeFocusMorning Service10:00 - 14:00Low-MediumBreakfast, Light mealsEvening Service17:00 - 21:00Medium-HighDinner, Full courses
4.2 Staff System
The player works alongside NPC staff members who can perform tasks autonomously with varying effectiveness:
Staff MemberRoleTraitManagement NeedMelodyServerEnthusiastic but clumsyOccasional pep talksBrunoChefSkilled but pridefulRecipe guidanceSageBusser/SupportLazy but perceptiveFrequent motivation
Staff Morale (0-100) affects their work efficiency. If left unattended, staff will slack off, reducing customer satisfaction. The player can:
• Talk to staff to boost morale (+10-20 based on dialogue choice)
• Assign specific tasks to override autonomous behavior
• Upgrade staff skills through story progression
4.3 Recipe System
4.3.1 Recipe Structure
 Recipe {     id: RecipeID     name: String     description: String     category: Enum (APPETIZER, MAIN, DESSERT, BEVERAGE, SPECIAL)          // Requirements     ingredients: Array<{itemId: ItemID, quantity: Integer, qualityMin: Integer}>     unlockCondition: Condition (story progress, discovery, etc.)          // Cooking     difficulty: Integer (1-5 stars)     rhythmPattern: RhythmSequence     cookTime: Integer (in-game minutes)          // Output     baseQuality: Integer (1-5)     satisfactionValue: Integer     priceRange: {min: Integer, max: Integer}          // Effects     dragonColorInfluence: {r: Float, g: Float, b: Float}     specialEffects: Array<EffectID> }
4.3.2 Cooking Minigame
Cooking uses a rhythm-based minigame where players press buttons in time with music:
• Each recipe has a unique musical track and rhythm pattern
• Notes appear on 4 lanes corresponding to controller buttons
• Timing grades: Perfect, Good, OK, Miss
• Final dish quality = Base Quality + (Performance Score * Quality Modifier)
• Ingredient quality provides bonus multiplier to final score
4.4 Customer System
 Customer {     id: CustomerID     type: Enum (REGULAR, STORY_CHARACTER, SPECIAL_EVENT)          // Appearance     spriteId: SpriteID     nameDisplay: String (generic for regulars, named for story)          // Behavior     patience: Integer (seconds before leaving unhappy)     orderPreferences: Array<RecipeCategory>     qualityExpectation: Integer (1-5)          // Order     currentOrder: RecipeID | null     orderTime: DateTime     satisfaction: Float (0-100)          // Rewards     baseTip: Integer     tipMultiplier: Float (based on satisfaction)     reputationGain: Integer }
4.5 Reputation System
Cafe Reputation (0-1000) determines customer volume, available recipes, and story progression gates:
Reputation LevelPoints RequiredBenefitsCustomer VolumeUnknown0-99Basic recipes only1-3 per serviceLocal Favorite100-299Intermediate recipes, garden upgrade3-6 per serviceTown Attraction300-599Advanced recipes, delivery service5-10 per serviceRegional Fame600-899Rare recipes, special customers8-15 per serviceLegendary900-1000All recipes, postgame content12-20 per service
